# Image inside Script
## Python 3.8 using base64 and Pillow library.

<br>

### Information:

- Convert image files into string or binary with base64 library.
- Using _Pillow_**ยน** library the Python interpreter will consider the string as an image object and the
image file will no longer be necessary for the script.

> **ยน** Imported as "PIL" inside the script.
